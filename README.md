# OutlanderCharger3DP
3D Printed Parts for the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV Charger - a popular option in DIY EV conversions.

Two parts in this repository so far:

 - Battery Connector Grommet & Cover
 This comes in two pieces. A grommet (for want of a better word) that goes into the lozenge-shaped opening
 on the Outlander PHEV 3.3kw charger case and seals with the addition of a rubber O-ring. And a cover that 
 slips over wires and links to the grommet to tidy things up and keep moisture away.

 The cover is designed to connect to 20mm unsplit cable shroud. It takes a little pressing to get it in, but 
 once it's in, it holds pretty well and looks nice and tidy. It can be a little awkward to fit it all 
 together with the stiff wires but it's as good as I've got so far.

  - Charge Port Grommet & Cover
  This part also comes in two pieces but should be glued together before being installed. Superglue/CA works
  really well. O-ring required again (sorry not fixed sizes yet). Bolts into the Charger case with two M5 
  screws. Again, a bit fiddly to get the wires through, especially if you already have your spade terminals 
  installed. But looks super tidy once in. This one is designed to take 16mm cable shroud. For some reason 
  (the tolerances are the same) it doesn't grip quite as well as the 20mm but still looks tidy.

Printing
I've printed everything in bright orange PET-G with 4 walls and 15% infill, and all seems very robust. All pieces designed for easy printing. Support only needed on print bed.


DC-DC connector cover to come.
